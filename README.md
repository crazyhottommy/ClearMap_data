# ClearMap_data

The original data was downloaded by 

```bash
wget https://idiscodotinfo.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/clearmap_ressources_mouse_brain.zip
```

I then replace the spaces in the fold names to "_" and put the data in [`osf`](https://osf.io/c7qm6/).

You can download by:

```bash
curl -O -J -L https://osf.io/c7qm6/download
```
